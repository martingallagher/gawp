# ![Gawp](http://praegress.us/gawp-logo.png)
A simple, configurable, file watching, job execution tool implemented in Go.

**gawp**<br>ɡɔːp/<br>*verb, British, informal*<br>stare openly in a stupid or rude manner.

## Installation
    go get -u gopkg.in/fsnotify.v1
    go get -u gopkg.in/yaml.v2
    go get -u github.com/martingallagher/gawp

The following assumes your Go $GOPATH/bin is on your $PATH environmental variable (`export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`).

## Configuration
By default Gawp attempts to read `.gawp` in the active directory. The file format is [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/).

The configuration file location can be set using the `-config my.conf` command-line flag.

**Example .gawp file:**

```yaml
recursive: true           # Watch directories recursively, default: true
verbose: false            # Verbose logging, default: false
workers: 4                # Number of concurrent workers (high numbers can thrash IO), default: number CPUs / 2 (minimum 1)
# logfile: gawp.log        # Gawp logfile, default: stdout

# start:
#  - start myscript

# stop:
#  - echo STOPPING!

write, create, rename:    # Actionable events (supported: create, write, rename, remove, chmod), executed sequentially
  (?i)([a-z]+)\.src\.js$: # Rules are regular expression strings (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)
  - msg=`jshint $file`; if [ "$msg" ]; then notify-send -t 2000 "$msg"; fi
  - java -jar ~/compiler.jar -O=ADVANCED --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT --formatting=SINGLE_QUOTES --define='DEBUG=false' --js_output_file=scripts/$1.js $file

  (?i)[a-z]+\.scss:
  - compass compile --boring --time -s compressed --css-dir styles/ $file
  - echo HELLO DENNIS!    # Rules can have multiple commands; output is written as-is to the Gawp log

create:
  .*:
  - echo created $file    # Rule submatches and file path can be accessed via $1, $2 ... $n (nth submatch) and $file

remove:
  .*:
  - echo removed $file
```

Configuration defaults fulfil most user's requirements, resulting in a config file that just defines rules:

```yaml
write, create, rename:
  (?i)([a-z]+)\.src\.js$:
  - msg=`jshint $file`; if [ "$msg" ]; then notify-send -t 2000 "$msg"; fi
  - java -jar ~/compiler.jar -O=ADVANCED --language_in=ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT --formatting=SINGLE_QUOTES --define='DEBUG=false' --js_output_file=scripts/$1.js $file

  (?i)[a-z]+\.scss:
  - compass compile --boring -s compressed --css-dir styles/ $file

create:
  .*:
  - echo created $file

remove:
  .*:
  - echo removed $file
```

# Usage
Assuming correctly configured `web/assets/.gawp` file: `cd web/assets/ && gawp`

## Atomic Save Support
Some IDE's e.g. NetBeans, perform "atomic" saves. Gawp attempts to detect such operations, running the matching rule commands only once. The threshold duration setting for detecting atomic saves `atomicthreshold` can be adjusted if you find it is too liberal/conservative for your underlying storage.

## Commands
Gawp does no command validation. It pre-processes them, replacing variables and executes blindly. Rules can contain subcommands, which is useful when you need to use subcommand results. For example, on Linux/Ubuntu you might wish to lint the edits to your JavaScript files and create an alert via `notify-send`:

```yaml
write:
  (?i)([a-z]+)\.src\.js$:
  - msg=`jshint $file`; if [ "$msg" ]; then notify-send -t 2000 "$msg"; fi
```

If there's output from `jshint`, a notification bubble will be displayed to the user with the result.
